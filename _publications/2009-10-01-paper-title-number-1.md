In this paper, we investigated how the brain responds to unpredictable and predictable rare events. Magnetoencephalography responses were measured in adults frequently presented with somatosensory stimuli (FRE) that were occasionally replaced by two consecutively presented rare stimuli [unpredictable rare stimulus (UR) and predictable rare stimulus (PR)].The results linked the early component M55, but not M150 to prediction error signals. Our findings highlight the need for disentangling prediction error and rareness-related effects in future studies investigating prediction error signals.
