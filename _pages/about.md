I am Qianru Xu (许茜如), a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS), University of Oulu, Finland. Currently, I'm working on an exciting project called ["Emotion AI"](https://emotion-ai.rahtiapp.fi/index.html) which is led by Prof. [Guoying Zhao](https://gyzhao-nm.github.io/Guoying/). Our interdisciplinary team is integrating neurosciences and computer vision to study various emotional cues. My main research focus is to leverage multimodal data to deepen our understanding of the neural mechanisms and behavioral manifestations that differentiate genuine from posed emotional states. Ultimately, we hope to help individuals improve their emotional well-being and foster more authentic human connections. In my previous research, I primarily focused on investigating brain responses (MEG/EEG) to somatosensory and emotional stimuli involving emotional pain (e.g., depression) and physical pain. 

In sum, my research is deeply rooted in the study of neural signatures and their relationship to behavioral changes, particularly in the context of understanding emotions and associated affective disorders. The core aim of my work is to unravel the complex neural underpinnings of emotion using the Emotion AI engine. This could lead to the development of more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for various emotional and behavioral disturbances.

In my previous research, I primarily focused on investigating brain responses (MEG/EEG) to somatosensory and emotional stimuli in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. My Ph.D. dissertation, titled ["Change detection in the surrounding world: evidence from the visual and somatosensory brain responses"]( http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-39-8791-6) was supervised by Assoc. prof. [Piia Astikainen](https://www.jyu.fi/edupsy/fi/laitokset/psykologia/en/staff/astikainen-piia) and Prof. [Jarmo Hämäläinen](https://www.jyu.fi/edupsy/fi/laitokset/psykologia/en/staff/hamalainen-jarmo). One of my ongoing projects revolves around understanding how physical pain, compared to emotional pain such as depression, alters emotional processing. This knowledge could be instrumental in the development of diagnostic tools and predicting treatment responses in the future.

As a researcher, I consider myself self-motivated and enthusiastic, always seeking new knowledge and embracing challenges. My personal motto is "To see the world" and "Stay curious." Beyond academia, I have a passion for traveling and scuba diving. So far, I have explored 49 countries and spent a total of 3,003 minutes underwater (with more adventures to come...).
