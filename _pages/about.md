I am Qianru Xu (è®¸èŒœå¦‚), a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS), University of Oulu, Finland. I am currently working on an Academy of Finland project ["Emotion AI"](https://emotion-ai.rahtiapp.fi/index.html) led by Prof. [Guoying Zhao](https://gyzhao-nm.github.io/Guoying/) with a group of researchers in computer science. We are doing interdisciplinary works by integrating neurosciences and computer vision to study spontaneous expressions. My research interests include the neural basis of emotional and somatosensory processing, pain perception, and human-computer interaction.

Previously, my research is mainly focusing on brain responses (MEG/EEG) to somatosensory and emotional stimuli both in depressed and non-depressed participants. My Ph.D. dissertation is entitled ["Change detection in the surrounding world: evidence from the visual and somatosensory brain responses"]( http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-39-8791-6) supervisered by Assoc. Prof. [Piia Astikainen](https://www.jyu.fi/edupsy/fi/laitokset/psykologia/en/staff/astikainen-piia) and Prof. [Jarmo HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen](https://www.jyu.fi/edupsy/fi/laitokset/psykologia/en/staff/hamalainen-jarmo). One of my current projects is trying to tackle how physical pain (compared to emotional pain such as depression) alters emotional processing. This information can be useful in the future for developing diagnostic tools and in predicting treatment responses.

I regard myself as a self-motivated and enthusiastic researcher, and I am always eager to learn new things and accept new challenges. My life slogan is "To see the world" and "Stay curious". I love traveling and scuba diving. Until now, I have been to 43 countries and spent 2,835 minutes underwater (to be continued...).
